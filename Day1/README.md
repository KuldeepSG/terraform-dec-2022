### Points to note
1. Don't use your corporate azure account, if you do the Azure pass will be reported invalid and goes invalid. The azure pass share only works one time
2. If you are using your personal azure account that has a free credit, applying the azure pass on that account makes your Free credit invalid imediately.
3. If you have already an Azure pass on the Azure account, your new azure will become invalid
